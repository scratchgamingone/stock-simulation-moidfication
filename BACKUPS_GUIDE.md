## 📊 Storage Information

### Browser Local Storage Limits
- **Chrome/Firefox/Safari:** ~5-10 MB per domain
- **Edge:** ~10 MB per domain
- **Storage varies:** Depends on browser settings

### File Size Estimation
- **Typical game state:** 20-100 KB per backup
- **With 50 backups:** 1-5 MB storage used
- **Storage recommendation:** Keep 5-10 recent backups

### Auto-Cleanup Recommendations
When approaching storage limits:
1. Download important backups first
2. Delete older backups not needed
3. Or clear all old backups and start fresh

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backup Service API

Located at: `src/services/backupService.ts`

```typescript
// Initialize the backups folder
initializeBackupsFolder(): void

// Save current game state as backup
saveBackup(data: any, filename?: string): BackupFile

// Get all saved backups
getAllBackups(): BackupFile[]

// Get specific backup by ID
getBackupById(id: string): BackupFile | undefined

// Delete a backup
deleteBackup(id: string): boolean

// Clear all backups
clearAllBackups(): void

// Download backup as file
downloadBackup(backupId: string): void

// Export entire backups folder
exportBackupsFolder(): void

// Get statistics
getBackupsStats(): BackupsStats
```

### Integration Points

The backup system integrates with:
- **Data Management View** - UI for backups folder
- **Redux Store** - Accesses complete app state
- **Browser Storage** - Persists backups in localStorage
- **File API** - Handles downloads and imports

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Safety
- ✅ Backups survive browser cache clears (stored in localStorage)
- ✅ Auto-backups on export (no manual creation needed)
- ⚠️ Clearing localStorage will delete ALL backups
- ⚠️ Browser history clearing does NOT affect backups

### Performance
- ✅ Minimal impact on app performance
- ✅ Backups stored efficiently in browser
- ✅ No server/internet required
- ✅ Instant backup creation and restoration

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ All modern browsers supported
- ✅ Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- ✅ Works offline after initial load

## 🔄 Workflow Example

```
Step 1: Play the game
└─ Game auto-saves to localStorage continuously

Step 2: Reach a milestone (day 100)
└─ Go to Data Management
└─ Click "Export to Backups Folder"
└─ Backup created successfully

Step 3: Continue playing (take risks)
└─ Try aggressive trades
└─ Might lose money or fail quests

Step 4: Realized the risks were too high
└─ Go back to Data Management
└─ Expand "Backups Folder"
└─ Click "Import Data from File"
└─ Select day 100 backup
└─ Game restored to day 100 state

Step 5: Try safer approach
└─ Continue from backed-up state
└─ Make better decisions this time
```
